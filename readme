HOW TO INSTALL PIP ON YOUR DEVICE
    The process of installing `pip` may vary depending on the operating system you are using. Here are the general steps for installing `pip` on different devices:

1. Windows:
   - Download the `get-pip.py` script from the official Python website: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
   - Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded `get-pip.py`.
   - Run the following command: `python get-pip.py`

2. macOS and Linux:
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run the following command to install `pip` using the package manager:
     - For Python 2: `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
     - For Python 3: `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

3. Linux (using package manager):
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run the appropriate command based on your distribution:
     - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
     - Fedora: `sudo dnf install python2-pip` (Python 2) or `sudo dnf install python3-pip` (Python 3)
     - CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install epel-release && sudo yum install python-pip` (Python 2) or `sudo yum install python3-pip` (Python 3)

After the installation, you can verify the `pip` installation by running `pip --version` in the command prompt or terminal. If the installation is successful, it will display the version of `pip` installed.

It's worth noting that on some systems, `pip` may be already installed by default. In such cases, you can upgrade `pip` to the latest version using the command: `pip install --upgrade pip`.

Remember to use administrative or superuser privileges (such as `sudo` on macOS/Linux) when required during the installation process.

It's important to download `pip` from official sources to ensure a safe and reliable installation.
